### Part A: Log and Metric Anomaly Detection

#### Step 1: Get Sample Data

Download the provided sample datasets (or generate synthetic data using the snippet below):

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
n = 500

# Normal operation: low error rate, stable latency
timestamps = pd.date_range("2025-10-01 08:00", periods=n, freq="1min")
cpu = rng.normal(35, 5, n)
error_rate = rng.exponential(0.002, n)
latency_p99 = rng.normal(150, 20, n)

# Inject anomalies at indices 200–215 (simulated incident)
cpu[200:216] = rng.normal(85, 5, 16)
error_rate[200:216] = rng.uniform(0.05, 0.15, 16)
latency_p99[200:216] = rng.normal(3500, 200, 16)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "timestamp": timestamps,
    "cpu_pct": np.clip(cpu, 0, 100),
    "error_rate": np.clip(error_rate, 0, 1),
    "latency_p99_ms": np.clip(latency_p99, 0, None)
})
df.to_csv("metrics_sample.csv", index=False)
print(df.head())
```

#### Step 2: Visualize the Data

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(14, 8), sharex=True)
df.set_index("timestamp")[["cpu_pct"]].plot(ax=axes[0], title="CPU %")
df.set_index("timestamp")[["error_rate"]].plot(ax=axes[1], title="Error Rate", color="red")
df.set_index("timestamp")[["latency_p99_ms"]].plot(ax=axes[2], title="Latency p99 (ms)", color="orange")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("metrics_overview.png", dpi=150)
plt.show()
```

#### Step 3: Run Isolation Forest

Apply isolation forest to the metrics and mark detected anomalies. Plot the anomaly scores overlaid on the original data.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

features = df[["cpu_pct", "error_rate", "latency_p99_ms"]]
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(features)

model = IsolationForest(n_estimators=200, contamination=0.04, random_state=42)
model.fit(X)

df["anomaly_score"] = model.decision_function(X)
df["is_anomaly"] = (model.predict(X) == -1)

print(f"Anomalies detected: {df['is_anomaly'].sum()} of {len(df)} points")
print(df[df["is_anomaly"]][["timestamp", "cpu_pct", "error_rate", "latency_p99_ms"]])
```

#### Step 4: Evaluate Your Detector

Since you injected the anomalies yourself (indices 200–215), you know the ground truth. Compute precision and recall:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

ground_truth = [1 if 200 <= i <= 215 else 0 for i in range(len(df))]
predictions = df["is_anomaly"].astype(int).tolist()

print(classification_report(ground_truth, predictions,
                             target_names=["Normal", "Anomaly"]))
```

**Experiment:** Change the `contamination` parameter to 0.01 and 0.10. How does precision vs. recall change?

> The starter packages the scoring as a tested pure function in
> [`project/anomaly/evaluation.py`](../../project/anomaly/evaluation.py) — including the "accuracy trap" test. Run `make test` there to see it.

<details><summary>✅ Check your understanding — why not just report accuracy?</summary>

Your dataset is ~98% normal. A detector that predicts **"normal" for everything** scores ~98% accuracy while catching **zero** anomalies (recall = 0) — useless. That's why `classification_report` shows **precision and recall for the Anomaly class**, and why tuning `contamination` is really tuning the precision↔recall trade-off:

- **Lower `contamination`** → fewer flags → higher precision, lower recall (you miss some).
- **Higher `contamination`** → more flags → higher recall, lower precision (more false alarms → alert fatigue).

Pick the balance from the *cost* of a miss vs. a false alarm for your service.

#### Step 5: Bonus — DBSCAN Comparison

Repeat steps 3–4 using DBSCAN instead of isolation forest. Which algorithm performs better on this dataset? Hypothesize why.

### Part B: Instrument an Agent with OpenTelemetry GenAI Conventions

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-api anthropic
```

#### Step 2: Write an Instrumented Agent

Adapt the code from Session 9 (Concept 5) to build a small "log analyzer agent" that:
1. Accepts a chunk of log text.
2. Calls an LLM to identify anomalies (or simulate a response if you don't have API access).
3. Emits OTel spans with the GenAI attributes: `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`.

#### Step 3: Export Spans and Analyze

Run your agent on 5 different log windows of varying sizes. Collect the span data (the `ConsoleSpanExporter` will print it to stdout; capture it in a file).

Build a small summary table:

| Log window size (chars) | Input tokens | Output tokens | Latency (ms) | Estimated cost ($) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Use Anthropic's current pricing to estimate the cost per call.

#### Step 4: Reflection Questions (submit in your write-up)

1. How did input token count correlate with log window size? Was the relationship linear?
2. At what rate would your agent's LLM cost accumulate if it processed 10 log windows per minute, 24/7 for a month?
3. What guardrail would you add to prevent runaway costs?
4. In the Foundations primer we said "treat your agents as first-class services." What would a production-grade dashboard for this agent look like? List five metrics you would track.

## Assignment — Week 5

**Title:** Intelligent Anomaly Detection and AI-Generated Root Cause Analysis

**Due:** Before the start of Week 6

**Submission:** GitHub repository link + 1-page written reflection (PDF)

---

### Objective

Build a small but complete anomaly detection and RCA system that:
1. Detects anomalies in a metric/log dataset using at least one ML-based approach.
2. Groups related alerts.
3. Uses an LLM agent to generate a structured root cause analysis report.
4. Emits OpenTelemetry GenAI spans from the agent steps.

| Agentic RCA system with at least 2 tools (metrics + logs) | 25 |
| Generated RCA report for a sample incident (in `output/`) | 15 |
| OTel GenAI spans emitted and captured | 10 |
| README + reflection: explains key decisions and trade-offs | 5 |
| **Total** | **100** |

### Rubric Hints

- **Anomaly detector:** Don't just run the code — tune the `contamination` or `eps` parameter and explain your reasoning. Full points require showing both precision and recall.
- **RCA report:** Quality matters more than length. A good report cites specific evidence, proposes a plausible causal mechanism, and suggests concrete preventive measures.
- **OTel spans:** At minimum, capture spans to a file using `ConsoleSpanExporter`. Bonus points for sending to a running Jaeger instance.
- **Reflection:** The best reflections discuss *failures* — what didn't work as expected and why. Describing a smooth experience with no surprises is less credible than honestly describing a bug you hit.
